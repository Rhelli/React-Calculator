## üî∞ The Project Brief

This project is part of a series of projects to be completed by students of [Microverse](https://www.microverse.org/).

As the first project in the React module and, having followed the initial lessons concerning stateless and stateful components, class components and functional components as well as state and props, this first project focuses on establishing foundational practical knowledge by building a simple calculator.

In this project, we are required to utilise the lessons learned from above.


## üñ±Ô∏è Technologies Used
**Languages & Frameworks**
 - JavaScript
 - React
 - CSS
 - Webpack

**Package Management & Packages**
 - NPM
 - [Big.js](https://github.com/MikeMcl/big.js/) for floating point arithmetic

**Linters & Quality Control**
 - [ESlint](https://eslint.org/)
 - [StyleLint](https://stylelint.io/)

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup & Usage
For a live version of the calculator, [head here.](https://rorys-react-calculator.herokuapp.com/)

1. To inspect and tinker with the code on your system, download this repo either [here](https://github.com/Rhelli/React-Calculator/archive/develop.zip) or from the link at the top of the page.

2. Now it's time to ensure you've got Node and NPM installed. If you do, skip this step. Otherwise, head on over to [nodejs's website](https://nodejs.org/en/) to download node with npm.

3. Time to go back to the project! Open your terminal (either in your text editor or otherwise) and 'cd' (i.e. navigate) to the root of this repo.

4. Time to install Webpack! Ensuring you're at this repo's root, enter the following command into your terminal. This will install webpack locally (to this project only):

        npm install --save-dev webpack

5. Finally, once webpack has installed successfully, run the following command to install all of the projects dependencies:

        npm install

#### Usage
To run the project locally on your machine, simply run `$npm run start`. This will initialise the calculator in a local server on your machine and open it in a new page of your chosen / default browser. Any updates to the code (as long as error-free), will be immediately reflected.
